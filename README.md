# D3-Challenge

This project is from the perspective of a data visualization position for a major metro paper. The goal is to analyze the current trends shaping peopleâ€™s lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand findings. 

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. The dataset that is used for this project is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau.
